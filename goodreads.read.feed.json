                            "Ambedkar's India is a collection of three of B.R. Ambedkar's most prominent speeches on caste and the Indian Constitution. <br /><br />\"In the fight for Swaraj, you fight with the whole nation on your side. In fighting caste system, you stand against the whole nation—and that too, your own.\" <br /><br />Annihilation of Caste is one of Ambedkar's best works in putting together how caste as a system has been eating up the roots of a rich cultural melting pot like India. \"Bhakti in religion could lead to salvation. But in politics, Bhakti is a sure road to eventual dictatorship.\" <br /><br />The Grammar of Anarchy reflects Ambedkar's ideas on how we need to pave the way for Independent India. It reflects his deep love and aspirations for India and its people. \"...the sub-divisions [of caste] have lost the open-door character of the class system, and have become self-enclosed units called castes.\"<br /><br /> Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development is an in-depth study of how classes went on to become castes and sub-castes to dot the Indian social system. This powerful narrative is a radical eye-opener."

                            "In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.<br /><br />In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.<br /><br />But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, <i>different.</i><br /><br />Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything."

                            "The most influential book of the past seventy-five years: a groundbreaking exploration of everything we know about what we don’t know, now with a new section called “On Robustness and Fragility.”<br /><br />A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br /> <br />Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”<br /> <br />For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb will change the way you look at the world, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, “On Robustness and Fragility,” which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.<br /><br />Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan is a landmark book—itself a black swan."

Because a killer is coming to Bolton, a coldly proficient assassin who never misses.<br /><br />Reacher’s original plan was to keep on moving. But the next 61 hours will change everything. The secrets are deadlier and his enemies are stronger than he could have guessed—but so is the woman whose life he’ll risk his own to save.<br /> <br />In  61 Hours , Lee Child has written a showdown thriller with an explosive ending that readers will talk about for a long time to come."

Only. Half. I stared at those words. The intent behind the comment was in no way malicious, but it hurt. I felt diminished. I felt like I was being robbed of something essential to me. And as I stared at my screen, realisation dawned. '#bothnothalf' I replied.</i>\n</b><br /><br />For over twenty-five years, actor Jassa Ahluwalia described himself as 'half Indian, half English'. His fluent Punjabi always prompted bewilderment, medical staff questioned the legitimacy of his name, and the world of casting taught him he wasn't 'the right kind of mixed-race'. Feeling caught between two worlds, it wasn't long before Jassa embarked on a call to we need to change how we think and talk about mixed identity.<br /><br />By delving into the media we grew up consuming and the legacies of empire we have been taught, Ahluwalia is there anything to be learnt from Rudyard Kipling? Why were movie stars urged to hide their mixed identities? To what extent did colonialism encourage or hinder mixed marriages? Is nationalism outdated? How can the politics of class and queer liberation inform our understanding of mixed identity?<br /><br /><i>Both Not Half </i>is a rallying cry for a new and inclusive future. It's a journey of self-discovery that unearths the historical roots of modern mixed identity as we know it, braving to deconstruct the binaries we have inherited and the narratives we passively accept. Part-memoir, this is a campaign for belonging in a divided world."

                            "SITA : AN ILLUSTRATED RETELLING OF THE RAMAYANA<br />It is significant that the only character in Hindu mythology, a king at that, to be given the title of ekam-patni-vrata, devoted to a single wife, is associated with the most unjust act of abandoning her in the forest to protect family reputation. This seems a deliberate souring of an uplifting narrative. Rams refusal to remarry to produce a royal heir adds to the complexity. The intention seems to be to provoke thought on notions of fidelity, property and self-image.<br /><br />And so the mythologist and illustrator Devdutt Pattanaik retells the Ramayana, drawing attention to the many oral, visual and written retellings composed in different times, in different places, by different poets, each one trying to solve the puzzle in its own unique way. <br /><br />This book approaches Ram by speculating on Sita: her childhood with her father, Janaka, who hosted sages mentioned in the Upanishads; her stay in the forest with her husband, who had to be a celibate ascetic while she was in the prime of her youth; her interactions with the women of Lanka, recipes she exchanged, emotions they shared; her connection with the earth, her mother, and with the trees, her sisters; her role as the Goddess, the untamed Kali as well as the demure Gauri, in transforming the stoic prince of Ayodhya into God."

                            "No matter your goals, <i>Atomic Habits</i> offers a proven framework for improving—every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.<br /><br />If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.<br /><br />Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.<br /><br />Learn how to:<br />- Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);<br />- Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;<br />- Design your environment to make success easier;<br />- Get back on track when you fall off course;<br />...and much more.<br /><br /><i>Atomic Habits</i> will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal."

                            "<b>Memory makes reality.</b><br /><br />That's what NYC cop Barry Sutton is learning, as he investigates the devastating phenomenon the media has dubbed False Memory Syndrome—a mysterious affliction that drives its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.<br /><br />That's what neuroscientist Helena Smith believes. It's why she's dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent.<br /><br />As Barry searches for the truth, he comes face to face with an opponent more terrifying than any disease—a force that attacks not just our minds, but the very fabric of the past. And as its effects begin to unmake the world as we know it, only he and Helena, working together, will stand a chance at defeating it.<br /><br />But how can they make a stand when reality itself is shifting and crumbling all around them?<br /><br />At once a relentless pageturner and an intricate science-fiction puzzlebox about time, identity, and memory, Recursion is a thriller as only Blake Crouch could imagine it—and his most ambitious, mind-boggling, irresistible work to date."

Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent.<br /> <br />Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself—and that now, her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first."

                            "For all of the West's failings - terrible food, cold weather, and questionable politicians with funny hair to name a few - it has its upsides. Konstantin would know. Growing up in the Soviet Union, he experienced first-hand the horrors of a socialist paradise gone wrong, having lived in extreme poverty with little access to even the most basic of necessities. It wasn't until he moved to the UK that Kisin found himself thriving in an open and tolerant society, receiving countless opportunities he would never have had otherwise.<br /><br />Funny, provocative and unswervingly perceptive, An Immigrant's Love letter to the West interrogates the developing sense of self-loathing the Western sphere has adopted and offers an alternative perspective. Exploring race politics, free speech, immigration and more, Kisin argues that wrongdoing and guilt need not pervade how we feel about the West - and Britain - today, and that despite all its ups and downs, it remains one of the best places to live in the world.<br /><br />After all, if an immigrant can't publicly profess their appreciation for this country, who can?"

                            "Disruption resulting from the proliferation of AI is coming. The authors of the bestselling Prediction Machines describe what you can do to prepare.<br /><br />Banking and finance, pharmaceuticals, automotive, medical technology, retail. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made its way into many industries around the world. But the truth is, it has just begun its odyssey toward cheaper, better, and faster predictions to drive strategic business decisions--powering and accelerating business. When prediction is taken to the max, industries transform. The disruption that comes with such transformation is yet to be felt--but it is coming.<br /><br />How do businesses prepare? In their bestselling first book, Prediction Machines, eminent economists Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb explained the simple yet game-changing economics of AI. Now, in Power and Prediction, they go further to reveal AI as a prediction technology directly impacting decision-making and to teach businesses how to identify disruptive opportunities and threats resulting from AI. Their exhaustive study of new developments in artificial intelligence and the past history of how technologies have disrupted industries highlights the striking phase we are now in: after witnessing the power of this new technology and before its widespread adoption--what they call \"the Between Times.\" While there continue to be important opportunities for businesses, there are also threats of disruption. As prediction machines improve, old ways of doing things will be upended. Also, the process by which AI filters into the many systems involved in application is very uneven. That process will have winners and losers. How can businesses leverage, or protect, their positions?<br /><br />Filled with illuminating insights, rich examples, and practical advice, Power and Prediction is the must-read guide for any business leader or policy maker on how to make the coming AI disruptions work for you rather than against you."

                            "Of all the mind-bending discoveries of physics--quarks, black holes, strange attractors, curved space--the existence of antimatter is one of the most bizarre. It is also one of the most difficult, literally and figuratively, to grasp. <br /> <br /> <em>Antimatter</em> explores this strange mirror world, where particles have identical yet opposite properties to those that make up the familiar matter we encounter everyday, where left becomes right, positive becomes negative, and where--should matter and antimatter meet--the resulting flash of blinding energy would make even thermonuclear explosions look feeble by comparison. Antimatter is an idea long beloved of science-fiction writers--but here, renowned science writer Frank Close shows that the reality of antimatter is even more intriguing than the fiction. We know that at one time antimatter and matter existed in perfect counterbalance, and that antimatter then perpetrated a vanishing act on a cosmic scale that remains one of the great mysteries of the universe. Today, antimatter does not exist normally, at least on Earth, but we know that it is real, as scientists are now able to make small pieces of it in particle accelerators, such as that at CERN in Geneva. Looking at the remarkable prediction of antimatter and how it grew from the meeting point of relativity and quantum theory in the early 20th century, at the discovery of the first antiparticles, at cosmic rays, annihilation, antimatter bombs, and antiworlds, Close separates the facts from the fiction about antimatter, and explains how its existence can give us profound clues about the origins and structure of the universe.<br /> <br /> For all those wishing to take a closer look at the flip side of the visible world, this lucidly written book shines a bright light into a truly strange realm. <br /> <br /> \"Beautifully written... This book will inspire a sense of awe in even the most seasoned of physics readers.\"<br /> --Amanda Gefter, <em>New Scientist</em><br /> <br /> \"This is a must read for fans of science and science fiction alike.\" --John Gribbin, <em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bbcfocusmagazine.com\">www.bbcfocusmagazine.com</a></em>"

He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.<br /><br />All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.<br /><br />His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.<br /><br />And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone.<br /><br />Or does he?"

                            "<em>The dinosaurs. </em>Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth’s most fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet’s great mysteries. Now <em>The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs </em>reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before.<br /><br />In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field—naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork—masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and <em>new </em>history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, <em>The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs</em> is a book for the ages.<br /><br />Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers—themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period—into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, <em>T. rex</em>,<em> Triceratops</em>, <em>Brontosaurus</em>, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs’ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth’s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a “sixth extinction.”<br /><br />Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research—which he calls “a new golden age of discovery”—and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than <em>T. rex</em>; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China.<br /><br />An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs’ epic saga, <em>The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs</em> will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come."

                            "In this groundbreaking addition to his New York Times bestselling Plant Paradox series, Steven R.Gundry, MD offers a definitive guide to the gut biome and its control over its home — us! — revealing the unimaginably complex and intelligent ecosystem controlling our health and teaching us how to heal our guts to prevent and reverse every type of disease. We may believe that we are the masters of our fates, but in reality, we are at the mercy of hundreds of trillions of single-celled organisms that exert control over every aspect of how our minds and bodies function. These are the diverse species of microbes living in our guts, mouths, and skin that work together synergistically to communicate with each other and with every system in our bodies. You are your microbiome’s home, and it wants to take care of you, but first you have to protect it. In Gut Check , Dr. Steven Gundry reveals the emerging science proving that Hippocrates was right – all disease begins in the gut. When our microbiomes are out of balance, it affects our immune systems, our hormone levels, our mental health, our longevity, and our risk of developing autoimmunity, heart, and neurodegenerative disease, as well as arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. Yet, not all hope is disease can also be healed in the gut if we choose to treat our microbes right. In Gut Check , Dr. Gundry shows us how.   In his warm, authoritative voice, Dr. Gundry provides us with the keys to unlocking our gut health, allowing our bodies, and its microbiome, to function at their highest potential. Sharing shocking new research as well as a detailed eating plan with food lists and recipes to heal and rebalance the microbiome, Gut Check provides the cutting-edge information and tools we need to repair our health and reclaim our lives. "

Geddes's lovely book will fill you with longing!</b>' The TimesSince the dawn of time, humans have worshipped the sun. And with good reason. Our biology is set up to work in partnership with it. From our sleep cycles to our immune systems and our mental health, access to sunlight is crucial for living a happy and fulfilling life. New research suggests that our sun exposure over a lifetime - even before we were born - may shape our risk of developing a range of different illnesses, from depression to diabetes.Bursting with cutting-edge science and eye-opening advice, Chasing the Sun explores the extraordinary significance of sunlight, from ancient solstice celebrations to modern sleep labs, and from the unexpected health benefits of sun exposure to what the Amish know about sleep that the rest of us don't.As more of us move into light-polluted cities, spending our days in dim offices and our evenings watching brightly lit screens, we are in danger of losing something our connection to the star that gave us life. It's a loss that could have far-reaching consequences that we're only just beginning to grasp."

The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. <br /><br />But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?<br /><br />"

Featherbank.<br /><br />But the town has a dark past. Twenty years ago, a serial killer abducted and murdered five residents. Until Frank Carter was finally caught, he was nicknamed \"The Whisper Man,\" for he would lure his victims out by whispering at their windows at night.<br /><br />Just as Tom and Jake settle into their new home, a young boy vanishes. His disappearance bears an unnerving resemblance to Frank Carter's crimes, reigniting old rumors that he preyed with an accomplice. Now, detectives Amanda Beck and Pete Willis must find the boy before it is too late, even if that means Pete has to revisit his great foe in prison: The Whisper Man.<br /><br />And then Jake begins acting strangely. He hears a whispering at his window..."

A woman in the back, silent and worried. And next to her, a huge man with a broken nose, hitching a ride east to Virginia. <br /><br />An hour behind them, a man lies stabbed to death in an old pumping station. He was seen going in with two others, but he never came out. He has been executed, the knife work professional, the killers vanished. Within minutes, the police are notified. Within hours, the FBI descends, laying claim to the victim without ever saying who he was or why he was there. <br /><br />All Reacher wanted was a ride to Virginia. All he did was stick out his thumb. But he soon discovers he has hitched more than a ride. He has tied himself to a massive conspiracy that makes him a threat - to both sides at once.<br /><br />14 hr., 30 min"

At the time, Watson was only 24, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science's greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions &amp; bitter rivalries. With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his &amp; Crick's desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work."

                            "Our brains are the most complex machines known to humankind, but they have an Achilles heel: the very molecules that allow us to exist can also sabotage our minds. Here are gripping accounts of unruly molecules and the diseases that form in their wake.<br /><br />A college student cannot remember if she has eaten breakfast. By dinner, she is strapped to a hospital bed, convinced she is battling zombies. A man planning to propose marriage instead becomes violently enraged, gripped by body spasms so severe that he nearly bites off his own tongue. One after another, poor farmers in South Carolina drop dead from a mysterious epidemic of dementia.<br /><br />With an intoxicating blend of history and intrigue, Sara Manning Peskin invites readers to play medical detective, tracing each diagnosis from the patient to an ailing nervous system. Along the way, Peskin entertains with tales of the sometimes outlandish, often criticized, and forever devoted scientists who discovered it all.<br /><br />Peskin never loses sight of the human impact of these conditions. Alzheimer’s Disease is more than the gradual loss of a loved one; it can be a family’s multigenerational curse. The proteins that abound in every cell of our bodies are not simply strings of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon; they are the building blocks of our personalities and relationships. <i>A Molecule Away from Madness</i> is an unputdownable journey into the deepest mysteries of our brains."

This new compilation of her published work features pieces on why you should pursue purpose over passion, embrace negative thinking, see the wisdom in daily routine, and become aware of the cognitive biases that are creating the way you see your life. Some of these pieces have never been seen; others have been read by millions of people around the world. Regardless, each will leave you thinking: this idea changed my life."

It soon became known as the Ministry for the Future, and this is its story. <br /><br />From legendary science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson comes a vision of climate change unlike any ever imagined. <br /><br />Told entirely through fictional eye-witness accounts, <i>The Ministry for the Future</i> is a masterpiece of the imagination, the story of how climate change will affect us all over the decades to come. <br /><br />Its setting is not a desolate, post-apocalyptic world, but a future that is almost upon us—and in which we might just overcome the extraordinary challenges we face. <br /><br />It is a novel both immediate and impactful, desperate and hopeful in equal measure, and it is one of the most powerful and original books on climate change ever written."

Which is good, because trouble--big, violent, complicated trouble--finds Reacher wherever he goes. And when trouble finds him, Reacher does not quit, not once...not ever. <br /><br />But some unfinished business has now found Reacher. And Reacher is a man who hates unfinished business. <br /><br />Ten years ago, a key investigation went sour and someone got away with murder. Now a chance encounter brings it all back. Now Reacher sees his one last shot. Some would call it vengeance. Some would call it redemption. Reacher would call it...justice."

But what would it look like to study the whole of history, from the big bang through the present day -- and even into the remote future? How would looking at the full span of time change the way we perceive the universe, the earth, and our very existence?<br /><br />These were the questions David Christian set out to answer when he created the field of \"Big History,\" the most exciting new approach to understanding where we have been, where we are, and where we are going. In <i>Origin Story</i>, Christian takes readers on a wild ride through the entire 13.8 billion years we've come to know as \"history.\" By focusing on defining events (thresholds), major trends, and profound questions about our origins, Christian exposes the hidden threads that tie everything together -- from the creation of the planet to the advent of agriculture, nuclear war, and beyond.<br /><br />With stunning insights into the origin of the universe, the beginning of life, the emergence of humans, and what the future might bring, <i>Origin Story</i> boldly reframes our place in the cosmos.<br /><br />"

                            "When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled <i>The Double Helix</i> on her bed. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would.<br /><br />Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned <b>​</b>a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions.<br /> <br />The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code.<br /> <br />Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids?<br /> <br />After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020."

                            "<b>From Harrison Scott Key, winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor, <i>How to Stay Married</i> tells the hilarious, shocking, and spiritually profound story of one man’s journey through hell and back when infidelity threatens his marriage.</b><br /><br />One gorgeous autumn day, Harrison discovers that his wife—the sweet, funny, loving mother of their three daughters, a woman “who’s spent just about every Sunday of her life in a church”—is having an affair with a family friend. This revelation propels the hysterical, heartbreaking action of How to Stay Married , casting our narrator onto “the factory floor of hell,” where his wife was now in love with a man who “wears cargo shorts, on purpose.” What will he do? Kick her out? Set fire to all her panties in the yard? Beat this man to death with a gardening implement? Ask God for help in winning her back?<br /><br />Armed with little but a sense of humor and a hunger for the truth, Harrison embarks on a hellish journey into his past, seeking answers to the riddles of faith and forgiveness. Through an absurd series of escalating confessions and betrayals, Harrison reckons with his failure to love his wife in the ways she needed most, resolves to fight for his family, and in a climax almost too ridiculous to be believed, finally learns that love is no joke. <i>How to Stay Married</i> is a comic romp unlike any in contemporary literature, a wild Pilgrim’s Progress through the hellscape of marriage and the mysteries of mercy."

                            "\"Harrison Scott Key's 'How to Stay Married: The Most Insane Love Story Ever Told' is a delightful dive into the complexities of love, marriage, and the inherent craziness that comes with it. Known for his witty and candid writing style, Key once again proves himself as a maestro of humor and heartfelt storytelling.<br /><br />In this book, Key shares personal anecdotes and reflections on his own marriage, weaving them together with humor and poignant insights. His ability to find hilarity in the mundane and to depict the intricate dynamics of a long-term relationship is commendable. Readers familiar with his previous works, such as 'The World's Largest Man,' will recognize his signature style infused with self-deprecating humor and genuine warmth.<br /><br />What sets 'How to Stay Married' apart is Key's evolution as a writer. While maintaining his trademark humor, he delves deeper into the intricacies of maintaining a marriage, sharing lessons learned, pitfalls faced, and the raw, unfiltered truths about the journey of commitment. This book feels like a maturation of Key's voice, offering not just laughs but also introspection and valuable life lessons.<br /><br />Comparing this work to his earlier books, 'How to Stay Married' showcases Key's growth as a writer. His storytelling remains engaging and entertaining, yet there's a newfound depth and emotional resonance that distinguishes this book from his previous ones. While 'The World's Largest Man' was more focused on Key's upbringing and family, 'How to Stay Married' ventures into the complexities of adult relationships, offering a refreshing perspective on the rollercoaster of married life.<br /><br />However, as much as the book shines in its humor and relatability, it may not resonate equally with every reader. Some might find the narrative pacing uneven or wish for a more consistent exploration of certain themes. Additionally, while Key's self-deprecating humor is endearing, it occasionally overshadows the more profound moments in the book, creating a slight imbalance in tone.<br /><br />Despite these nuances, 'How to Stay Married: The Most Insane Love Story Ever Told' is a charming and insightful read. Key's witty prose, sprinkled with genuine wisdom about the trials and triumphs of marriage, makes it a worthwhile addition to any reader's collection. It's a testament to his ability to capture the essence of human relationships with equal measures of humor and heart.<br /><br />Rating: 3 out of 5 stars. This book is a commendable addition to Harrison Scott Key's repertoire, showcasing his growth as a writer while maintaining his trademark humor. While it may not be a perfect fit for every reader, its candid portrayal of the complexities of marriage makes it a valuable and enjoyable read for those seeking both laughs and introspection.\""

                            "Jack Reacher plans to follow the autumn sun on an epic road trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn't get far. On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been - the town where his father was born. He thinks, what's one extra day? He takes the detour.<br /><br />At the very same moment, close by, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians are trying to get to New York City to sell a treasure. They are stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. It's a strange place ... but it's all there is.<br /><br />The next morning in the city clerk's office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He's told no one named Reacher ever lived in that town. He knows his father never went back. Now he wonders, was he ever there in the first place?<br /><br />So begins another nail-biting, adrenaline-fuelled adventure for Reacher. The present can be tense, but the past can be worse. That's for damn sure."

                            "Past Tense by Lee Child<br /><br />\"Past Tense\" by Lee Child is another thrilling adventure with the iconic character Jack Reacher. My review, as a fan of Jack Reacher and Child’s writing style, is based on my personal preferences, and while I found many aspects of the book enjoyable, there were some elements that left me wanting more.<br /><br />Let's start with the positives:<br /><br />1. Classic Reacher: Lee Child's writing style remains consistent, and Jack Reacher's character is as compelling as ever. Reacher's unwavering sense of justice and his ability to handle any situation with intelligence and brute force continue to captivate readers.<br />2. Engaging Plot: The story's dual narrative, with Reacher investigating his family's history alongside the suspenseful events involving Shorty and Patty, adds depth and complexity to the plot. It keeps the reader engaged and eager to uncover the mysteries.<br />3. Action Sequences: Lee Child is known for his well-choreographed action sequences, and \"Past Tense\" doesn't disappoint in this regard. The book is filled with intense, pulse-pounding moments that remind readers why they love Reacher novels.<br /><br />Now, onto some of the drawbacks:<br /><br />1. Pacing: While the book is action-packed, the pacing felt uneven at times. The parallel storylines occasionally slowed the overall momentum of the plot, leaving me eager to return to Reacher's perspective.<br />2. Resolution: Without giving away spoilers, the resolution of certain storylines left me wanting more closure and depth. Some questions felt unanswered, which was a bit frustrating.<br />3. Predictability: Die-hard Reacher fans may find some of the plot twists and reveals to be somewhat predictable. While I appreciate the familiar Reacher formula, a bit more unpredictability could have added to the suspense.<br /><br />\"Past Tense\" is a solid addition to the Jack Reacher series, offering the trademark action and intrigue that fans have come to expect. While it may not be the absolute pinnacle of the series, it still delivers an enjoyable and entertaining experience for those who love Reacher's adventures."

This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.</p><p>What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake?<em> Homo Deus</em> explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.</p><p>With the same insight and clarity that made <em>Sapiens</em> an international hit and a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, Harari maps out our future. </p>"

The book covers a wide array of thought-provoking topics, ranging from the evolution of Homo sapiens to the potential for immortality through technology, and the rise of data-driven decision-making. Harari's writing is engaging and thought-provoking, encouraging readers to contemplate the profound changes underway in our world.<br /><br />However, while \"Homo Deus\" is undeniably intellectually stimulating, it may not be for everyone. The book can at times be dense and challenging, especially for those without a strong background in philosophy, history, or technology. Some readers may find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer breadth of topics covered.<br /><br />Furthermore, Harari's predictions about the future are speculative, and not all readers may agree with his perspectives. The book can come across as pessimistic, particularly when discussing the potential consequences of technological advancements.<br /><br />In terms of a rating, I would give \"Homo Deus\" a 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's a valuable read for those interested in the intersection of technology, society, and philosophy, but it may not resonate equally with all readers due to its complexity and speculative nature. It's a book that sparks important discussions and challenges conventional thinking, but it may leave some searching for more concrete answers about our future."

                            "\"Ikigai\" is a thought-provoking exploration of the Japanese concept of finding purpose and fulfillment in life. The book delves into the idea that one's \"ikigai\" is the intersection of four elements: what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.<br /><br />This concept offers readers a valuable framework for self-discovery and personal growth. It encourages individuals to reflect on their passions, talents, societal contributions, and financial sustainability. By doing so, it inspires a holistic approach to life that goes beyond mere career goals.<br /><br />The book presents compelling case studies and practical exercises to help readers identify and incorporate their \"ikigai\" into their daily lives. It stresses the importance of aligning one's actions with their inner sense of purpose, leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful existence.<br /><br />However, while \"Ikigai\" is insightful and inspirational, it occasionally falls short in providing concrete strategies for those facing significant life challenges or complex circumstances. Additionally, some readers may find the writing style a bit repetitive at times.<br /><br />In conclusion, \"Ikigai\" is a valuable guide for anyone seeking to live a more purposeful and harmonious life. Its principles, if applied diligently, can lead to increased satisfaction and happiness. With its insightful perspective, this book deserves a 3.5 out of 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️1️⃣➗2️⃣/⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The car contained one million dollars in ransom money because Edward Lane, the man who paid it, would do anything to get his family back.<br /><br />Lane runs a highly illegal soldiers-for-hire operation. He will use any tool to find his beautiful wife and child. And Jack Reacher is the best manhunter in the world.<br /><br />On the trail of vicious kidnappers, Reacher learns the chilling secrets of his employer’s past . . . and of a horrific drama in the heart of a nasty little war. He knows that Edward Lane is hiding something. Something dirty. Something big. But Reacher also knows He’s already in way too deep to stop now. And if he has to do it the hard way, he will."

                            "Six shots. Five dead. One heartland city thrown into a state of terror. But within hours the cops have it solved: a slam-dunk case. Except for one thing. The accused man says: You got the wrong guy. Then he says: Get Reacher for me. And sure enough, from the world he lives in—no phone, no address, no commitments–ex–military investigator Jack Reacher is coming. In Lee Child’s astonishing new thriller, Reacher’s arrival will change everything—about a case that isn’t what it seems, about lives tangled in baffling ways, about a killer who missed one shot–and by doing so give Jack Reacher one shot at the truth.…<br /><br />The gunman worked from a parking structure just thirty yards away–point-blank range for a trained military sniper like James Barr. His victims were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But why does Barr want Reacher at his side? There are good reasons why Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see. But when Reacher hears Barr’s own words, he understands. And a slam-dunk case explodes. Soon Reacher is teamed with a young defense lawyer who is working against her D.A. father and dueling with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Like most things Reacher has known in life, this case is a complex battlefield. But, as always, in battle, Reacher is at his best.<br /><br />Moving in the shadows, picking his spots, Reacher gets closer and closer to the unseen enemy who is pulling the strings. And for Reacher, the only way to take him down is to know his ruthlessness and respect his cunning–and then match him shot for shot…"

There's just one thing they didn't plan on: Reacher."

                            "Hitching rides is an unreliable mode of transport. In temperatures of over a hundred degrees, you’re lucky if a driver will open the door of his air-conditioned car long enough to let you slide in. That’s Jack Reacher’s conclusion. He’s adrift in the fearsome heat of a Texas summer, and he needs to keep moving through the wide open vastness, like a shark in the water. The last thing he’s worried about is exactly who picks him up.<br /><br />He never expected it to be somebody like Carmen. She’s alone, driving a Cadillac. She’s beautiful, young and rich. She has a little girl who is being watched by unseen observers. And a husband who is in jail. Who will beat her senseless when he comes out. If he doesn’t kill her first.<br /><br />Reacher is no stranger to trouble. And at Carmen’s remote ranch in Echo County there is plenty of it: lies and prejudice, hatred and murder. Reacher can never resist a lady in distress. Her family is hostile. The cops can’t be trusted. The lawyers won’t help. If Reacher can’t set things straight, who can?"

On a downtown sidewalk, Jack Reacher and an unknown woman are abducted in broad daylight by two men - practiced and confident - who stop them at gunpoint and hustle them into the same sedan. Then Reacher and the woman are switched into a second vehicle and hauled away, leaving the dentist bound and gagged inside his car with the woman's abandoned possessions, two gallons of gasoline. . . and a burning match. The FBI is desperate to rescue the woman, a Special Agent from the Chicago office, because the FBI always - always - takes care of its own, and because this woman is not just another agent. Reacher and the woman join forces, against seemingly hopeless odds, to outwit their captors and escape. But the FBI thinks Jack is one of the kidnappers - and when they close in, the Bureau snipers will be shooting to kill."

Is the murderer a local guy - or is he a soldier?<br /><br />Jack Reacher, still a major in the military police, is sent in undercover. The county sheriff is a former US Marine - and a stunningly beautiful woman. Her investigation is going nowhere. Is the Pentagon stonewalling her? Or doesn't she really want to find the killer?<br /><br /><b>The adrenaline-pumping, high-voltage action in <i>The Affair</i> is set just six months before the opening of <i>Killing Floor</i>, and it marks a turning point in Reacher's career. If he does what the army wants, will he be able to live with himself? And if he doesn't, will the army be able to live with him?<br /><br />Is this his last case in uniform?</b>"

                            "Document the architecture of your software easily with this highly practical, open-source template. When developers document the architecture of their systems, they often invent their own specific ways of articulating structures, designs, concepts, and decisions. What they need is a template that enables simple and efficient software architecture documentation. arc42 by Example shows how it's done through several real-world examples. Each example in the book, whether it is a chess engine, a huge CRM system, or a cool web system, starts with a brief description of the problem domain and the quality requirements. Then, you'll discover the system context with all the external interfaces. You'll dive into an overview of the solution strategy to implement the building blocks and runtime scenarios. The later chapters also explain various cross-cutting concerns and how they affect other aspects of a program. This book is for software developers and solutions architects who are looking for an easy, open-source tool to document their systems. It is a useful reference for those who are already using arc42. If you are new to arc42, this book is a great learning resource. For those of you who want to write better technical documentation will benefit from the general concepts covered in this book."

The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years. <br /><br />The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” <br /><br />The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee’s own leukemia patient, Carla, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. <br /><br />Riveting, urgent, and surprising, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer."

                            "\"Emperor of All Maladies\" by Siddhartha Mukherjee deserves a solid 4 out of 5 stars. This book is a captivating journey through the history of cancer, offering a remarkable blend of accessible cancer-related biology, real-life cases, and compelling storytelling. Mukherjee's writing style masterfully weaves facts and personal experiences, making complex topics approachable for lay readers.<br /><br />The title, \"Emperor of All Maladies,\" aptly reflects the pervasive and formidable nature of cancer. It signifies how cancer, like a relentless ruler, has historically loomed large in the lives of individuals and communities. Cancer is a disease that has, at times, seemed unbeatable and all-encompassing, much like an emperor's dominion.<br /><br />Mukherjee's book not only educates readers about the science and history of cancer but also offers hope by highlighting the progress made in its treatment. Overall, \"Emperor of All Maladies\" is a highly informative and engaging read that sheds light on the multifaceted aspects of cancer, earning its well-deserved place on the bookshelf of anyone interested in this complex disease."

                            "From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem."

                            "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari is a thought-provoking exploration of the history of our species. I appreciate Harari's captivating writing style, his ability to weave together complex ideas, and his talent for storytelling.<br /><br />Harari delves into pivotal moments in human history, shedding light on significant developments that have shaped our world. One such moment is the cognitive revolution, which occurred around 70,000 years ago when Homo sapiens acquired the ability to think and communicate in unprecedented ways. This cognitive leap paved the way for the emergence of complex social structures and cooperation, driving our species forward.<br /><br />Another crucial aspect Harari delves into is the Agricultural Revolution. Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from nomadic hunting and gathering societies to settled agricultural communities. This revolution fundamentally transformed our way of life, leading to the rise of civilization, the development of cities, and the birth of agriculture as a foundation for human sustenance.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Harari challenges conventional wisdom and offers insightful perspectives. He explores the concept of money as a collective fiction, highlighting its role in facilitating economic exchanges and cooperation on a large scale. This thought-provoking notion encourages readers to question the fundamental structures that govern our societies.<br /><br />Harari also delves into the profound impact of the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions. These transformative periods in human history brought about groundbreaking discoveries and technological advancements that have shaped every aspect of our existence. The author emphasizes the significance of these revolutions, underscoring their role in propelling our species forward and reshaping the world as we know it.<br /><br />While reading Sapiens, it's impossible to ignore the influence of empires. Harari examines the rise and fall of various empires throughout history, emphasizing their impact on cultural exchange, trade, and the spread of ideas. By understanding the dynamics of empires, readers gain valuable insights into the interconnectedness of human societies and the forces that have shaped our global civilization.<br /><br />It is important to note that Sapiens presents a range of thought-provoking ideas and interpretations, which have sparked debates and controversies within the academic community. Harari's perspectives, while compelling, are not without their critics. Therefore, it is essential for readers to approach these controversial aspects with an open mind and engage in further exploration and research to form a well-rounded understanding.<br /><br />Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a captivating book that skillfully weaves together complex ideas, historical facts, and thought-provoking perspectives. Harari's engaging writing style and talent for storytelling make the book accessible and intriguing. The inclusion of pivotal moments, such as the cognitive and agricultural revolutions, as well as the impact of empires, provides readers with a comprehensive understanding of the forces that have shaped human history. Despite the controversial aspects, this book is a valuable read for anyone interested in delving into the story of our species and understanding the development of humanity."

He addresses not only the ethical quandaries faced by contemporary scientists but the reductionist danger in equating inheritability with inevitability.” — The New Yorker The genome's been mapped. But what does it mean? Matt Ridley’s Genome is the book that explains it what it is, how it works, and what it portends for the future Arguably the most significant scientific discovery of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life. Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome. It will help you understand what this scientific milestone means for you, for your children, and for humankind."

                            "3.8 stars out of 5<br /><br />I recently explored the captivating world of genetics through \"Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters.\" Penned by renowned geneticist Matt Ridley, this ambitious work aims to unravel the intricacies of our genetic makeup and its profound influence on our lives.<br /><br />Ridley's writing style is engrossing, skillfully blending scientific knowledge with captivating storytelling. He takes readers on a journey through the twenty-three chapters of the book, each dedicated to a specific chromosome, unveiling the marvels and mysteries of the human genome. The author's ability to explain complex concepts in an accessible manner is commendable, making this book suitable for readers with varying levels of scientific knowledge.<br /><br />\"Genome\" presents a wealth of fascinating facts that illuminate our understanding of genetics. Ridley explores a wide range of topics, from the genetic basis of disease to the origins of human behavior, providing readers with a comprehensive overview of our species' genetic heritage. He introduces us to the intricacies of DNA sequencing, the roles of genes in shaping our traits, and the interplay between nature and nurture in shaping our lives. The book is enriched with thought-provoking examples and case studies that highlight the real-world implications of genetic discoveries.<br /><br />However, one aspect of the book that falls short is the final chapter, where Ridley attempts to discuss \"the gene for free will.\" While the topic is undoubtedly intriguing, the author's approach in this chapter feels somewhat forced and speculative. Ridley ventures into philosophical territory without providing concrete evidence or a strong scientific foundation to support his claims. This departure from the otherwise factual and evidence-based nature of the book is somewhat jarring and might leave readers expecting a more substantive exploration of the subject.<br /><br />To improve the book, Ridley could have approached the concept of free will in a more balanced and nuanced manner. By incorporating a broader range of perspectives from both genetics and philosophy, he could have fostered a more meaningful dialogue on this complex topic. A more comprehensive discussion would have added depth and credibility to the book's overall exploration of the human genome.<br /><br />In conclusion, \"Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters\" still deserves a solid rating of 3.8 to 4 stars out of 5. Ridley's engrossing writing style and the wealth of factual information presented make this book a valuable resource for anyone curious about the complexities of our genetic blueprint. However, the shortcomings in the final chapter prevent it from reaching its full potential. Despite this, it remains a worthwhile read for those with a genuine interest in genetics and a willingness to engage critically with the subject matter."

                            "We inhabit a planet in peril. Our once temperate world is locked on course to become a hothouse entirely of our own making.<br /><br />Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant's Guide provides a post-COP26 perspective on the climate emergency, acknowledging that it is now practically impossible to keep this side of the 1.5°C dangerous climate change guardrail. The upshot is that we can no longer dodge the arrival of disastrous, all-pervasive, climate breakdown that will come as a hammer blow to global society and economy.<br /><br />Bill McGuire, Professor of Geophysical and Climate Hazards, explains the science behind the climate crisis and for the first time presents a blunt but authentic picture of the sort of world our children will grow old in, and our grandchildren grow up in; a world that we catch only glimpses of in today's blistering heatwaves, calamitous wildfires and ruinous floods and droughts. Bleak though it is, the picture is one we must all face up to, if only to spur genuine action - even at this late stage - to stop a harrowing future becoming a truly cataclysmic one."

Intent only on refueling before moving along on his road trip, he finds sustenance of an entirely different kind. In addition to the specials of the day, the cafe menu lists three questions all diners are encouraged to consider:<br /><br />Why are you here?<br /><br />Do you fear death?<br /><br />Are you fulfilled?<br /><br />With this food for thought and the guidance of three people he meets at the cafe, John embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way he discovers a new way to look at life, himself, and just how much you can learn from a green sea turtle."

                            "The Cafe on the Edge of the World is a novel written by John Strelecky. The book tells the story of a man named John, who is feeling lost and unhappy in his life. One day, he decides to take a detour on his way home and ends up at a cafe located on the edge of the world. The novel explores the themes of purpose, meaning, and happiness in life.<br /><br />Finding Purpose in Life<br /><br />At the cafe, John meets a server named Casey, who helps him to reflect on his life and find his purpose. Casey introduces John to the concept of the five questions, which are essential for finding purpose in life. These questions are:<br /><br />- What is your purpose?<br />- Why are you here?<br />- Do you fear death?<br />- Are you fulfilled?<br />- Would you rather be right or happy?<br /><br />Through these questions, John realizes that he has been living a life that is not aligned with his purpose. He decides to make changes in his life, starting with his career.<br /><br />Pursuing Happiness<br /><br />Another important theme in the novel is the pursuit of happiness. John learns that happiness is not something that can be bought or achieved through external means. Instead, it is something that comes from within. He realizes that he has been chasing after material possessions and success, but these things have not brought him true happiness.<br /><br />At the cafe, John meets other characters who have pursued happiness in different ways. Each character has a unique story and perspective on life, but they all share the same desire for happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />Embracing the Unknown<br /><br />The cafe on the edge of the world is a metaphor for the unknown and the uncertain. John learns that it is okay to not have all the answers and to embrace the unknown. He realizes that life is a journey, and the destination is not always clear.<br /><br />Conclusion: Embracing the Unknown<br /><br />The conclusion of the novel emphasizes the importance of embracing the unknown. John realizes that the cafe on the edge of the world was not just a physical place, but a state of mind. He understands that he can access this state of mind anytime he wants, by embracing the unknown and living in the present moment. The Cafe on the Edge of the World is a thought-provoking novel that encourages readers to reflect on their lives and find their purpose and happiness.<br /><br />⭐⭐ stars<br /><br />This novel tells the story of a man who finds purpose and happiness at a cafe on the edge of the world. While the themes of purpose, meaning, and happiness are important, the execution falls short. The characters are not well-developed, and the dialogue can be contrived and preachy at times. The concept of the five questions is interesting, but it feels too simplistic and formulaic. The pursuit of happiness is a worthy goal, but the novel's portrayal of it feels naive and idealistic. Overall, The Cafe on the Edge of the World is a mediocre novel that fails to deliver on its promise."

The book tells the story of a man named John, who is feeling lost and unhappy in his life. One day, he decides to take a detour on his way home and ends up at a cafe located on the edge of the world. The novel explores the themes of purpose, meaning, and happiness in life.<br /><br />Finding Purpose in Life<br /><br />At the cafe, John meets a server named Casey, who helps him to reflect on his life and find his purpose. Casey introduces John to the concept of the five questions, which are essential for finding purpose in life. These questions are:<br /><br />- What is your purpose?<br />- Why are you here?<br />- Do you fear death?<br />- Are you fulfilled?<br />- Would you rather be right or happy?<br /><br />Through these questions, John realizes that he has been living a life that is not aligned with his purpose. He decides to make changes in his life, starting with his career.<br /><br />Pursuing Happiness<br /><br />Another important theme in the novel is the pursuit of happiness. John learns that happiness is not something that can be bought or achieved through external means. Instead, it is something that comes from within. He realizes that he has been chasing after material possessions and success, but these things have not brought him true happiness.<br /><br />At the cafe, John meets other characters who have pursued happiness in different ways. Each character has a unique story and perspective on life, but they all share the same desire for happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />Embracing the Unknown<br /><br />The cafe on the edge of the world is a metaphor for the unknown and the uncertain. John learns that it is okay to not have all the answers and to embrace the unknown. He realizes that life is a journey, and the destination is not always clear.<br /><br />Conclusion: Embracing the Unknown<br /><br />The conclusion of the novel emphasizes the importance of embracing the unknown. John realizes that the cafe on the edge of the world was not just a physical place, but a state of mind. He understands that he can access this state of mind anytime he wants, by embracing the unknown and living in the present moment. The Cafe on the Edge of the World is a thought-provoking novel that encourages readers to reflect on their lives and find their purpose and happiness.<br /><br />⭐⭐ stars<br /><br />This novel tells the story of a man who finds purpose and happiness at a cafe on the edge of the world. While the themes of purpose, meaning, and happiness are important, the execution falls short. The characters are not well-developed, and the dialogue can be contrived and preachy at times. The concept of the five questions is interesting, but it feels too simplistic and formulaic. The pursuit of happiness is a worthy goal, but the novel's portrayal of it feels naive and idealistic. Overall, The Cafe on the Edge of the World is a mediocre novel that fails to deliver on its promise.<br/>\n                                      \n    "

                            "<b>A groundbreaking exploration of why we want what we want, and a toolkit for freeing ourselves from chasing unfulfilling desires.</b><br /><br />Gravity affects every aspect of our physical being, but there's a psychological force just as powerful – yet almost nobody has heard of it. It's responsible for bringing groups of people together and pulling them apart, making certain goals attractive to some and not to others, and fueling cycles of anxiety and conflict. In <i>Wanting</i>, Luke Burgis draws on the work of French polymath René Girard to bring this hidden force to light and reveals how it shapes our lives and societies.<br /><br />According to Girard, humans don't desire anything independently. Human desire is <i>mimetic</i> – we imitate what other people want. This affects the way we choose partners, friends, careers, clothes, and vacation destinations. Mimetic desire is responsible for the formation of our very identities. It explains the enduring relevancy of Shakespeare's plays, why Peter Thiel decided to be the first investor in Facebook, and why our world is growing more divided as it becomes more connected.<br /><br /><i>Wanting</i> also shows that conflict does not arise because of our differences--it comes from our sameness. Because we learn to want what other people want, we often end up competing for the same things. Ignoring our large similarities, we cling to our perceived differences.<br /><br />Drawing on his experience as an entrepreneur, teacher, and student of classical philosophy and theology, Burgis shares tactics that help turn blind wanting into intentional wanting – not by trying to rid ourselves of desire, but by desiring differently. It's possible to be more in control of the things we want, to achieve more independence from trends and bubbles, and to find more meaning in our work and lives.<br /><br />The future will be shaped by our desires. <i>Wanting</i> shows us how to desire a better one."

                            "Mimetic desire, also known as mimesis, is a concept that suggests that our desires are influenced by the desires of the people around us. It is an innate tendency that we have to imitate the desires of those we admire, leading to a cycle of wanting. This means that we tend to want what others want, and this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the context.<br /><br />On the one hand, mimetic desire can inspire us to pursue positive goals and to better ourselves. For example, we may see someone we admire who has achieved great success in their career, and we may be motivated to work hard to achieve similar success. Mimetic desire can also inspire us to be more compassionate, kind, and generous, as we may see others exhibiting these qualities and want to emulate them.<br /><br />However, on the other hand, mimetic desire can also lead to negative consequences. For example, we may become envious of someone who has something that we want, and this can lead to feelings of resentment and bitterness. We may also engage in rivalry with others, seeking to outdo them in order to prove our worth. In extreme cases, mimetic desire can even lead to violence, as we may be willing to harm others in order to achieve our desires.<br /><br />Wanting is a thought-provoking book that explores the concept of mimetic desire. The author, Luke Burgis, argues that our desires are shaped by the desires of other people around us. He explains how we unconsciously mimic the desires of those we admire, leading to a never-ending cycle of wanting.<br /><br />Burgis draws on examples from various fields, including psychology, philosophy, economics, and literature, to demonstrate the power of mimetic desire in our everyday lives. He also examines the negative consequences of mimetic desire, such as envy, rivalry, and violence.<br /><br />One of the most important points in the book is that mimetic desire is not necessarily a bad thing. Burgis argues that it can be a powerful force for positive change when it is channeled properly. He suggests that we can use our mimetic desire to pursue worthy goals and to inspire others to do the same.<br /><br />Overall, mimetic desire is a powerful force that can shape our lives in both positive and negative ways. It is important to be aware of this tendency and to use it wisely, channeling it towards positive goals and avoiding the negative consequences of envy, rivalry, and violence. <br /><br />Wanting is a fascinating and insightful book that offers a fresh perspective on the nature of desire and its role in shaping our lives. It is a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, philosophy, or personal development."

And what makes people happy?</b><br /><br />From earth's nations and inhabitants, through the fuels and foods that energize them, to the transportation and inventions of our modern world - and how all of this affects the planet itself - in <i>Numbers Don't Lie</i>, Professor Vaclav Smil takes us on a fact-finding adventure, using surprising statistics and illuminating graphs to challenge lazy thinking.<br /><br />Packed with 'well-I-never-knew-that' information and with fascinating and unusual examples throughout, we see how it is too soon to judge shale gas, that vaccination yields the best return on investment, and why electric cars aren't as great as we think (yet). There's a wonderful mix of science, history and wit, all in bite-sized chapters on a broad range of topics.<br /><br /><b>Should you trust unemployment figures? Is China's rise unstoppable? And what's worse for the environment: your car or mobile phone?</b><br /><br />Unclouded by pessimism or optimism and unafraid of big questions, Smil explains why calls for the Anthropocene era may be premature but why the Paris Agreement does not go far enough. These issues are not straightforward and progress takes longer than you think, but with Smil as our authoritative and entertaining guide we get a healthy shot of realism.<br /><br />Urgent and essential, <i>Numbers Don't Lie</i> is a powerful rallying cry for interrogating what you take to be true in these significant times. Smil is on a mission to make facts matter, because after all, numbers may not lie, but which truth do they convey?"

                            "Vaclav Smil's \"Numbers Don't Lie: 71 Things You Need to Know About the World\" is a comprehensive and data-driven exploration of the world's most pressing issues. The author uses easy-to-digest facts and figures to paint a vivid picture of the current state of the world.<br /><br />While the book provides a lot of interesting and informative data, it can be quite dense and may not be easily accessible to all readers. The sheer volume of information presented in the book can be overwhelming, and some may find it challenging to keep up with the author's rapid-fire presentation of facts.<br /><br />However, despite these challenges, the book has received praise from Bill Gates, who has commended Smil for his ability to distill complex information into an understandable format. This is a testament to the value of the book's content and the author's expertise in presenting it.<br /><br />Overall, \"Numbers Don't Lie\" is a valuable resource for anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the world's most pressing issues. Despite its density, the book offers a wealth of information that is both fascinating and thought-provoking. For those willing to put in the effort, this book is an excellent tool for expanding one's knowledge and gaining a data-driven perspective on the world.<br /><br />Based on the facts presented in the book, I would give \"Numbers Don't Lie\" a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars.

But they're about to face a new challenge because - surprise - Rosie is pregnant. <br /><br />Don sets about learning the protocols of becoming a father, but his unusual research style gets him into trouble with the law. Fortunately his best friend Gene is on hand to offer advice: he's left Claudia and moved in with Don and Rosie. <br /><br />As Don tries to schedule time for pregnancy research, getting Gene and Claudia to reconcile, servicing the industrial refrigeration unit that occupies half his apartment, helping Dave the Baseball Fan save his business, and staying on the right side of Lydia the social worker, he almost misses the biggest problem of all: he might lose Rosie when she needs him the most."

                            "The Rosie Effect by Graeme Simsion is a must-read book that is sure to put a smile on your face and leave you feeling fulfilled. It is a wonderful continuation of The Rosie Project that delves deeper into the character of Don and explores the importance of friendships, as well as his relationship with Rosie and how he saves it with a fantastic ending.<br /><br />The story is a perfect blend of humor, heartwarming moments, and important themes that will leave you feeling happy and positive about life. In fact, it's one of the most endearing books I've ever read. The characters are so relatable, and the author does an exceptional job of developing each character and their relationships with each other.<br /><br />Don Tillman is a charming and lovable character. He has a unique personality, with his quirks, intelligence, and determination to improve his life and those around him. Don is a professor of genetics who struggles with social interaction due to his Asperger's Syndrome. He is also a devoted husband who is willing to go to great lengths to help his wife, Rosie, and their unborn child.<br /><br />Rosie is Don's wife, and she is equally delightful as Don. She is smart, funny, and independent, and she shares a deep bond with Don. Rosie is a psychology student in the book and is determined to help Don overcome his social challenges. She is also pregnant, which adds to the complexity of their relationship.<br /><br />Gene is Don's friend and colleague, and he is an important character in the book. He is a free-spirited and fun-loving person who provides a good contrast to Don's more reserved personality. Gene is also a significant source of support for Don and Rosie throughout the book.<br /><br />One important moment in the book is when Don discovers that he is going to be a father, which leads to a series of events that test his relationship with Rosie. Another important moment is when Don tries to help his friend Gene with his own relationship problems, which ultimately leads to a falling out between them. The book also explores the importance of friendship, which is a recurring theme throughout the story.<br /><br />What I particularly enjoyed about this book is how the author infused humor into the story while still managing to tackle important themes. Graeme Simsion's writing style is simply amazing. He has a way of tackling important human emotions with his funny writing style that leaves you laughing and feeling good about life. The way he blends humor and heartwarming moments in the story is absolutely brilliant. I found myself giggling and grinning throughout the book and sometimes shedding a tear or two. The story is not just hilarious, but it's also heartfelt and touching.<br /><br />Overall, The Rosie Effect is an absolute masterpiece that I would give a 5 out of 5 stars rating. Graeme Simsion's exceptional writing style combined with a heartwarming story makes this book a must-read for anyone who loves to read. This book is a perfect escapism read, especially in these times where we need something to make us forget our worries and stress. Trust me, you won't regret reading this book. It's a book that you will want to share with your friends and family."

                            "An international sensation, this hilarious, feel-good novel is narrated by an oddly charming and socially challenged genetics professor on an unusual quest: to find out if he is capable of true love.<br /><br />Don Tillman, professor of genetics, has never been on a second date. He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which he approaches all things, Don sets out to find the perfect partner. She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.<br /><br />Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also beguiling, fiery, intelligent—and on a quest of her own. She is looking for her biological father, a search that a certain DNA expert might be able to help her with. Don's Wife Project takes a back burner to the Father Project and an unlikely relationship blooms, forcing the scientifically minded geneticist to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that love is not always what looks good on paper.<br /><br /><i>The Rosie Project</i> is a moving and hilarious novel for anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of overwhelming challenges."

Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.<br /><br />By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.<br /><br />But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.<br /><br />In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.<br /><br />(Note: this title was not published as YA fiction)"

                            "Towards the end of the twentieth century, those who advocated what became known as 'Political Correctness' rightly identified the ways in which marginalised groups were often disparaged in everyday speech. Casual expressions of homophobia, racism and sexism went from being commonplace to being rejected by the vast majority of the public over the course of just two decades.<br /><br />Since then, the victories of Political Correctness have formed the basis for a new intolerant mindset, one that seeks to move beyond simply reassessing the social contract of shared discourse to actively policing speech that is deemed offensive or controversial. Rather than confront bad ideas through discussion, it has now become common to intimidate one's detractors into silence through 'cancel culture', a ritual of public humiliation and boycotting which can often lead to the target losing his or her means of income.<br /><br />Free Speech is a defence of our right to express ourselves as we see fit, and takes the form of a letter to those who are unpersuaded. Taking on board legitimate concerns about how speech can be harmful, Andrew Doyle argues that the alternative - an authoritarian world in which our freedoms are surrendered to those in power - has far worse consequences."

                            "Free speech is a fundamental right that is essential to a democratic society. In his book, Free Speech And Why It Matters, Andrew Doyle explores the importance of free speech and the threats it faces in today's society.<br /><br />Doyle argues that free speech is essential for the pursuit of truth, the exchange of ideas, and the development of knowledge. He believes that censorship and self-censorship hinder progress and leave society vulnerable to tyranny.<br /><br />The book explains how free speech has been under attack in recent years, with many people seeking to silence those with whom they disagree. Doyle argues that this trend is dangerous and that we must defend free speech if we want to protect democracy and individual liberty.<br /><br />In Free Speech And Why It Matters, Doyle also explores the role of social media in the free speech debate. He argues that social media companies have too much power to silence voices that they deem to be offensive or harmful. He believes that we need to find a way to balance the need for free speech with the need to protect people from harm.<br /><br />Ultimately, Free Speech And Why It Matters is a call to action. Doyle urges readers to defend free speech and to stand up to those who seek to silence it. He argues that we must be willing to engage in difficult conversations and to listen to those with whom we disagree if we want to protect our fundamental freedoms.<br /><br />I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars. Andrew Doyle does an excellent job of explaining why free speech is so important in today's society. He highlights the dangers of censorship and self-censorship, and argues that we must defend free speech if we want to protect democracy and individual liberty.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the book is its accessibility. Doyle explains complex ideas in a clear and concise manner, making it a must-read for people who are confused about what free speech is and why it matters.<br /><br />However, the book is not without its flaws. At times, Doyle's arguments can be repetitive and he doesn't offer many solutions to the problems he identifies. Additionally, while he does touch on the role of social media in the free speech debate, he could have delved deeper into this issue.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend Free Speech And Why It Matters to anyone who is interested in the topic of free speech. While it may not be a perfect book, it provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing conversation about this important issue."

                            "Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics."

                            "Money is a topic that can bring on a lot of stress and anxiety for many people. That's why it's important to understand the psychology behind our relationship with money.

This book is not only informative but also an enjoyable read, making it a must-read for anyone looking to have a better understanding of their financial mindset.<br /><br />Concise and to the Point<br /><br />One of the standout features of \"The Psychology of Money\" is its brevity. The book is only 256 pages, but it manages to pack an immense amount of information into its pages. The author, Morgan Housel, does an excellent job of presenting complex financial concepts in a way that is easy to understand. He uses real-life examples that readers can relate to, making it an engaging and thought-provoking read.<br /><br />Fun Storytelling<br /><br />Another aspect of \"The Psychology of Money\" that makes it such an enjoyable read is the author's storytelling. Housel has a knack for weaving together stories and anecdotes that illustrate his points perfectly.

The ring is tiny, for a woman, and it has her initials engraved on the inside. Reacher wonders what unlucky circumstance made her give up something she earned over four hard years. He decides to find out. And find the woman. And return her ring. Why not?<p>So begins a harrowing journey that takes Reacher through the upper Midwest, from a lowlife bar on the sad side of small town to a dirt-blown crossroads in the middle of nowhere, encountering bikers, cops, crooks, muscle, and a missing persons PI who wears a suit and a tie in the Wyoming wilderness.</p><p>The deeper Reacher digs, and the more he learns, the more dangerous the terrain becomes. Turns out the ring was just a small link in a far darker chain. Powerful forces are guarding a vast criminal enterprise. Some lines should never be crossed. But then, neither should Reacher.</p>"

However, after reading it, I can say that it is not one of the best Jack Reacher novels. I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Lack of Action<br /><br />One of the things that I love about the Jack Reacher series is the action. The books are usually packed with action and suspense. However, in The Midnight Line, the plot is slow-paced and lacks the action that I was expecting. There are a few action scenes, but they are not as thrilling as in other Jack Reacher novels. I was expecting more from this book, especially since it is the twenty-second novel in the series.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />The plot of The Midnight Line is another aspect that I was not impressed with. It is not as strong as in other Jack Reacher books. It is more of a detective story, with Reacher trying to find the owner of a West Point class ring that he finds in a pawnshop. The story is predictable and lacks the twists and turns that I was expecting. The villain is also not as compelling as in other novels, and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic.<br /><br />Character Development<br /><br />One of the things that I did appreciate about The Midnight Line is the character development. Reacher shows a more compassionate side in this novel, and we get to see a different side of him. He is still the tough guy that we know and love, but we get to see him in a more vulnerable state. The other characters in the book are also well-developed, especially the female characters.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Midnight Line is not one of the best Jack Reacher novels. It lacks the action and suspense that the series is known for, and the plot is weak and predictable. However, the character development is impressive, and we get to see a different side of Reacher. If you are a fan of the series, you should still read the book, but do not expect it to be as thrilling as the other novels."

                            "Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.<br /><br />Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.<br /><br />Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....<br /><br /><b><i>The Silent Patient</i> is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.</b>"

                            "The Silent Patient: A 5-Star Thriller<br /><br />If you're looking for a page-turning thriller with a shocking ending, look no further than The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides. This novel has taken the literary world by storm, and for good reason. As a reader, I was captivated by the story from start to finish, and I give it a solid 5-star rating.<br /><br />Unpredictable Twist<br /><br />One of the major strengths of The Silent Patient is the unpredictable twist towards the end. The story follows Alicia Berenson, a famous artist who is found guilty of murdering her husband and then stops speaking altogether. Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, becomes obsessed with unlocking Alicia's silence and discovering the truth behind the murder. Just when you think you have the story figured out, Michaelides throws a curveball that will leave you gasping. The twist is so unexpected, yet perfectly executed. It's the kind of ending that will have you thinking about the book for weeks after you finish it.<br /><br />Subtle Criticism<br /><br />While I thoroughly enjoyed The Silent Patient, there is one subtle criticism I have about the author's writing style. Michaelides frequently relies on clichés and overused phrases, which can be distracting at times. However, this is a minor issue in the grand scheme of things and doesn't detract from the overall quality of the story.<br /><br />Gripping Characters<br /><br />Beyond the plot and twist, The Silent Patient also boasts gripping characters. Alicia is a complex and fascinating character, and her silence adds an extra layer of intrigue to the story. Theo is equally compelling, and his determination to uncover the truth is admirable. The supporting characters are also well-developed and add depth to the story.<br /><br />Overall, The Silent Patient is a must-read for fans of the thriller genre. It's a well-crafted, gripping story with a twist that will leave you reeling. Despite some minor flaws in the writing style, the quality of the story and characters more than make up for it. If you're looking for a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, look no further than The Silent Patient."

                            "<i>Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738</i><br /><br />In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \"positive\" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.<br /><br />For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br /><br />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br /><br />There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives."

                            "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, written by Mark Manson, is a self-help book that talks about living a satisfying life by focusing on what truly matters. The title might seem controversial, but the book is a refreshing take on the genre. I would rate it a 4 out of 5, as it offers valuable insights, but some chapters could have been more concise.<br /><br />The author's approach<br /><br />What sets this book apart from others in its category is the author's approach. Mark Manson doesn't believe in the traditional self-help mantra of positive thinking and affirmations. Instead, he advocates for embracing negative experiences and feelings and using them as motivation to live a fulfilling life. He argues that by accepting that life is not perfect, we can stop chasing unrealistic goals and focus on what truly matters.<br /><br />The value of the book<br /><br />The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a thought-provoking read that challenges readers to reassess their priorities. The book offers practical advice on how to deal with adversity and create a more meaningful life. It's refreshing to read a self-help book that doesn't sugarcoat the realities of life and instead encourages readers to face them head-on.<br /><br />The author's writing style<br /><br />Mark Manson's writing style is engaging and humorous. He uses anecdotes and personal experiences to illustrate his points, which makes the book relatable and easy to read. While some chapters could have been more concise, the book is well-written and structured in a way that makes it easy to follow.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a valuable addition to the self-help genre. Mark Manson's approach is refreshing, and his writing style is engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a new perspective on living a satisfying life."

The title might seem controversial, but the book is a refreshing take on the genre. I would rate it a 4 out of 5, as it offers valuable insights, but some chapters could have been more concise.<br /><br />The author's approach<br /><br />What sets this book apart from others in its category is the author's approach. Mark Manson doesn't believe in the traditional self-help mantra of positive thinking and affirmations. Instead, he advocates for embracing negative experiences and feelings and using them as motivation to live a fulfilling life. He argues that by accepting that life is not perfect, we can stop chasing unrealistic goals and focus on what truly matters.<br /><br />The value of the book<br /><br />The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a thought-provoking read that challenges readers to reassess their priorities. The book offers practical advice on how to deal with adversity and create a more meaningful life. It's refreshing to read a self-help book that doesn't sugarcoat the realities of life and instead encourages readers to face them head-on.<br /><br />The author's writing style<br /><br />Mark Manson's writing style is engaging and humorous. He uses anecdotes and personal experiences to illustrate his points, which makes the book relatable and easy to read. While some chapters could have been more concise, the book is well-written and structured in a way that makes it easy to follow.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a valuable addition to the self-help genre. Mark Manson's approach is refreshing, and his writing style is engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a new perspective on living a satisfying life.<br/>\n                                      \n    "

                            "Why \"We Were Liars\" Deserves a 1 out of 5 Stars Rating<br /><br />\"We Were Liars\" by E. Lockhart was a book that gained a lot of popularity and attention upon its release. However, after reading it, I found it to be a major disappointment.<br /><br />Lack of Character Development<br /><br />One of the biggest flaws of this book is the lack of character development. The four main characters, the Liars, are supposed to be the heart of the story. However, their personalities are poorly developed, and the reader is left feeling disconnected and uninterested in their lives. The characters are one-dimensional, with no real depth to their personalities, and no clear motivations for their actions. As a result, the reader is unable to connect with them or care about their story.<br /><br />Predictable Plot Twist<br /><br />The plot twist in \"We Were Liars\" is supposed to be the highlight of the book. However, it is predictable and underwhelming. The twist is revealed in the last few pages, and by that point, the reader has already figured it out. This makes the whole book feel like a waste of time, as the reader is left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.<br /><br />Poor Writing Style<br /><br />The writing style of \"We Were Liars\" is another reason why I gave it a low rating. The prose is overly simplistic, lacking in detail, and at times, confusing. The author tries to create a dream-like atmosphere, but instead, the writing comes across as vague and disjointed. This makes it difficult for the reader to fully immerse themselves in the story and connect with the characters.<br /><br />In conclusion, \"We Were Liars\" is a book that failed to live up to its hype. The lack of character development, predictable plot twist, and poor writing style make it a tedious read. While it may have appealed to some readers, it was not a book that I enjoyed, and I cannot recommend it. Overall, I believe that \"We Were Liars\" deserves a 1 out of 5 stars rating."

                            "The Theory of Everything is a book written by Stephen Hawking, one of the most renowned physicists of our time. It is an autobiographical account of his life, work, and theories. Hawking's book has been widely read, and it has been praised as a masterpiece by some.

                            "In his book \"A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes\", Stephen Hawking takes us on a journey through the history of the universe, exploring its origins, evolution, and ultimate fate. Along the way, he highlights a number of fascinating facts and open questions that continue to intrigue scientists and laypeople alike.<br /><br />The Big Bang<br /><br />According to Hawking, the universe began with the Big Bang, a massive explosion that occurred approximately 13.8 billion years ago. At this moment, the universe was incredibly hot and dense, and it rapidly expanded and cooled, eventually forming the galaxies, stars, and planets we see today. Despite our current understanding of the Big Bang, many questions remain unanswered. For example, what caused the explosion? Was there anything before the Big Bang?<br /><br />The Expanding Universe<br /><br />One of the most remarkable discoveries in modern astronomy is that the universe is not only expanding, but that the rate of expansion is accelerating. This discovery was made possible by the study of Type Ia supernovae, which are used as standard candles to measure distances to galaxies. Despite this discovery, the cause of the accelerated expansion remains a mystery. Hawking also notes that the universe's expansion raises another question: will it continue to expand indefinitely, or will it eventually collapse in on itself?<br /><br />Black Holes<br /><br />Black holes are one of the most intriguing and mysterious objects in the universe. According to Hawking, black holes are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, creating a singularity - a point of infinite density and zero volume. Once inside the black hole's event horizon, nothing can escape its gravitational pull, not even light. Although we have made significant progress in our understanding of black holes, many questions remain. For example, what happens to the information that falls into a black hole? Does it disappear forever, violating the laws of quantum mechanics?<br /><br />In conclusion, \"A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes\" is a fascinating exploration of the history of the universe and the open questions that continue to intrigue scientists. Although we have made significant progress in our understanding of the universe, there is still much we do not know. As Stephen Hawking notes, \"The universe is full of surprises, and there is much to be learned from exploring its mysteries.\""

                            "The world is in the grips of mass formation—a dangerous, collective type of hypnosis—as we bear witness to loneliness, free-floating anxiety, and fear giving way to censorship, loss of privacy, and surrendered freedoms. It is all spurred by a singular, focused crisis narrative that forbids dissident views and relies on destructive groupthink.<br /><br /><i>“Alternative voices are stigmatized by a veritable Ministry of Truth, which is crowded with “fact checkers.” Freedom of speech is curtailed by various forms of censorship and self-censorship; people’s right to self-determination is infringed upon by coercive vaccination strategies, which impose heretofore unthinkable social exclusion and segregation upon society.”</i><br /><br />Desmet’s work on mass formation theory was brought to the world’s attention on <i>The Joe Rogan Experience</i> and in major alternative news outlets around the globe. Read this book to get beyond the sound bites!<br /><br />Totalitarianism is not a coincidence and does not form in a vacuum. It arises from a collective psychosis that has followed a predictable script throughout history, its formation gaining strength and speed with each generation—from the Jacobins to the Nazis and Stalinists—as technology advances. Governments, mass media, and other mechanized forces use fear, loneliness, and isolation to demoralize populations and exert control, persuading large groups of people to act against their own interests, always with destructive results.<br /><br />In <i>The Psychology of Totalitarianism</i>, world-renowned Professor of Clinical Psychology Mattias Desmet deconstructs the societal conditions that allow this collective psychosis to take hold. By looking at our current situation and identifying the phenomenon of “mass formation”—a type of collective hypnosis—he clearly illustrates how close we are to surrendering to totalitarian regimes.<br /><br />With detailed analyses, examples, and results from years of research, Desmet lays out the steps that lead toward mass formation, including:<br />- An overall sense of loneliness and lack of social connections and bonds<br />- A lack of meaning—unsatisfying “bullsh*t jobs” that don’t offer purpose<br />- Free-floating anxiety and discontent that arise from loneliness and lack of meaning<br />- Manifestation of frustration and aggression from anxiety<br />- Emergence of a consistent narrative from government officials, mass media, etc., that exploits and channels frustration and anxiety <br /><br />In addition to clear psychological analysis—and building on Hannah Arendt’s essential work on totalitarianism, <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i>—Desmet offers a sharp critique of the cultural “groupthink” that existed prior to the pandemic and advanced during the COVID crisis. He cautions against the dangers of our current societal landscape, media consumption, and reliance on manipulative technologies and then offers simple solutions—both individual and collective—to prevent the willing sacrifice of our freedoms.<br /><br /><br /><i>“We can honor the right to freedom of expression and the right to self-determination without feeling threatened by each other,” Desmet writes. “But there is a point where we must stop losing ourselves in the crowd to experience meaning and connection.

                            "\"The Psychology of Totalitarianism\" is a thought-provoking book that provides an insightful explanation of how we are living in a totalitarian society. The author brilliantly explains how our every action is being monitored and regulated by the government and corporations. The book sheds light on how our freedom is being stripped away, and how we are being manipulated by those in power.<br /><br />The author's arguments are well-researched and compelling, making the book a valuable read. However, one downside of the book is that it has a tendency to strengthen the already manipulated views of the people against vaccination and other conspiracy theories. The author's description of how we are being strictly regulated by everything happening around us can be misinterpreted and lead to further mistrust towards the government and health organizations.<br /><br />Counterarguments to the author's points:<br /><br />- While it is true that there are certain instances where our actions are monitored for safety and security purposes, not every action is being monitored and regulated by the government and corporations. There are still many aspects of our lives that are private and not under continuous surveillance.<br />- Our freedom is not being completely stripped away. While there are certain restrictions in place for the greater good of society, we still enjoy a lot of freedom to make our own decisions and lead our lives as we see fit.<br />- While it is true that there are people in power who may try to manipulate the masses for their own gain, it is not fair to paint all those in power with the same brush. There are many individuals who work tirelessly to improve the lives of others and ensure that everyone has an equal chance at success.<br /><br />It's important to consider multiple perspectives and not make sweeping generalizations about complex issues like these.<br /><br />In order to maintain a balanced and neutral perspective, it is important to present counterarguments to the facts presented in the book. The author's views should be read with a critical eye, and readers should take the time to research and understand the opposing views.<br /><br />Despite this, \"The Psychology of Totalitarianism\" presents a fresh perspective on the current state of our society. The book is thought-provoking and encourages readers to question the status quo. It is a valuable read for anyone interested in politics and society.<br /><br />Overall, \"The Psychology of Totalitarianism\" deserves 3 out of 5 stars. It is recommended for everyone, but should be read with a very neutral perspective to avoid being swayed by the author's opinions."

                            "<strong>An Instant <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller!</strong><br /><br /><strong>China has concentration camps <em>now</em>. Why do Westerners claim our sins are unique?</strong><br /><br />It is now in vogue to celebrate non-Western cultures and disparage Western ones. Some of this is a much-needed reckoning, but much of it fatally undermines the very things that created the greatest, most humane civilization in the world.<br /><br />In <em>The War on the West</em>, Douglas Murray shows how many well-meaning people have been fooled by hypocritical and inconsistent anti-West rhetoric. After all, if we must discard the ideas of Kant, Hume, and Mill for their opinions on race, shouldn't we discard Marx, whose work is peppered with racial slurs and anti-Semitism? Embers of racism remain to be stamped out in America, but what about the raging racist inferno in the Middle East and Asia?<br /><br />It's not just dishonest scholars who benefit from this intellectual fraud but hostile nations and human rights abusers hoping to distract from their own ongoing villainy. Dictators who slaughter their own people are happy to jump on the \"America is a racist country\" bandwagon and mimic the language of antiracism and \"pro-justice\" movements as PR while making authoritarian conquests.<br /><br />If the West is to survive, it must be defended.<strong> </strong><em>The War on the West </em>is not only an incisive takedown of foolish anti-Western arguments but also a rigorous new apologetic for civilization itself."

                            "The War on the West: A Direct Question to our Over-Sensitive World<br /><br />Douglas Murray, the British journalist and author, has become a prominent figure in the ongoing debates surrounding identity politics and multiculturalism. The War on the West is a powerful critique of the ways in which these ideologies have shaped Western societies, and how they have led to a culture of political correctness that stifles free speech and hinders honest discussions about race and ethnicity. In this blog post, we will explore three key themes from Murray's book and how they relate to the current state of our over-sensitive world.<br /><br />The Danger of Identity Politics<br /><br />Murray argues that the rise of identity politics is a threat to the fundamental principles of Western democracy. He believes that the focus on group identity, rather than individual merit and achievement, has created a culture where people are judged based on their skin color, gender, and sexual orientation, rather than their ideas and actions. This, according to Murray, has led to a lack of intellectual diversity and a reluctance to engage in open and honest discussions about difficult topics like race and ethnicity.<br /><br />The Tyranny of Political Correctness<br /><br />Murray also takes aim at political correctness, which he sees as a form of tyranny that has taken hold in Western societies. He argues that the fear of being labeled a racist or a bigot has led to a culture of self-censorship, where people are afraid to speak their minds and express their opinions openly. This, he believes, is a dangerous trend that threatens the very foundations of free speech and open debate.<br /><br />The Need for Intellectual Courage<br /><br />Finally, Murray calls for a return to intellectual courage, where people are willing to engage in honest and open discussions about difficult topics, even if it means facing criticism and backlash from those who disagree with them. He believes that this is the only way to address the complex issues facing Western societies, and to move beyond the culture of political correctness and identity politics that have dominated public discourse in recent years.<br /><br />Douglas Murray's The War on the West is a timely and important book that raises important questions about the state of our over-sensitive world. Murray's critique of identity politics and political correctness is a powerful reminder of the need for free speech, intellectual diversity, and intellectual courage in our public discourse. As we continue to grapple with complex issues like race and ethnicity, we would do well to heed Murray's call for a return to these fundamental principles of Western democracy."

                            "The Rosie Result: A Perfectly Balanced Read<br /><br />The Rosie Result, the third and final book in the Don Tillman series by Graeme Simsion, is a must-read for anyone looking for a book that balances important topics like health and raising children with comedy and a great story. Simsion’s writing style keeps readers engaged and entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />A Touching Story on Health<br /><br />One of the key themes in The Rosie Result is Don’s struggle with his health. The book takes a deep dive into Don’s diagnosis with Asperger’s syndrome, and how it affects his life, relationships, and work. However, the author doesn't dwell too much on the diagnosis, and instead, focuses on how Don deals with it and moves forward. This approach makes the story relatable and inspiring, as it shows that people can overcome their challenges if they have the right mindset and support system.<br /><br />Raising Children with Comedy<br /><br />Another significant theme in The Rosie Result is Don and Rosie’s journey of raising their son, Hudson. The book touches on issues such as education, parenting, and family dynamics. However, what makes this story unique is the way it balances these heavy topics with humor. Simsion's writing style is witty and sarcastic, which adds a layer of comedy to the story without taking away from the seriousness of the issues at hand.<br /><br />## A Great Balance<br /><br />Overall, The Rosie Result is a perfectly balanced read. The book tackles important topics, but does so in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming or too heavy. The comedy element keeps the story engaging and enjoyable, while the underlying themes of health and raising children provide depth and substance. Simsion's writing style is a delight to read, and he manages to create a perfect balance between the serious and the comedic.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Rosie Result is a must-read for anyone looking for a book that touches on important topics like health and raising children, while maintaining an element of comedy and a great story. Simsion's writing style is engaging, and his ability to balance serious themes with humor is what makes this book so enjoyable. If you haven't read The Rosie Result yet, I highly recommend that you do."

Simsion’s writing style keeps readers engaged and entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />A Touching Story on Health<br /><br />One of the key themes in The Rosie Result is Don’s struggle with his health. The book takes a deep dive into Don’s diagnosis with Asperger’s syndrome, and how it affects his life, relationships, and work. However, the author doesn't dwell too much on the diagnosis, and instead, focuses on how Don deals with it and moves forward. This approach makes the story relatable and inspiring, as it shows that people can overcome their challenges if they have the right mindset and support system.<br /><br />Raising Children with Comedy<br /><br />Another significant theme in The Rosie Result is Don and Rosie’s journey of raising their son, Hudson. The book touches on issues such as education, parenting, and family dynamics. However, what makes this story unique is the way it balances these heavy topics with humor. Simsion's writing style is witty and sarcastic, which adds a layer of comedy to the story without taking away from the seriousness of the issues at hand.<br /><br />## A Great Balance<br /><br />Overall, The Rosie Result is a perfectly balanced read. The book tackles important topics, but does so in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming or too heavy. The comedy element keeps the story engaging and enjoyable, while the underlying themes of health and raising children provide depth and substance. Simsion's writing style is a delight to read, and he manages to create a perfect balance between the serious and the comedic.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Rosie Result is a must-read for anyone looking for a book that touches on important topics like health and raising children, while maintaining an element of comedy and a great story. Simsion's writing style is engaging, and his ability to balance serious themes with humor is what makes this book so enjoyable. If you haven't read The Rosie Result yet, I highly recommend that you do.<br/>\n                                      \n    "

                            "There has to be a moment at the beginning when you wonder whether you're in love with the person or in love with the feeling of love itself.<br /><br />If the moment doesn't pass, that's it―you're done. And if the moment does pass, it never goes that far. It stands in the distance, ready for whenever you want it back. Sometimes it's even there when you thought you were searching for something else, like an escape route, or your lover's face.<br /><br />How does one talk about love? Do we even have the right words to describe something that can be both utterly mundane and completely transcendent, pulling us out of our everyday lives and making us feel a part of something greater than ourselves? Taking a unique approach to this problem, the nameless narrator of David Levithan's The Lover's Dictionary has constructed the story of his relationship as a dictionary. Through these short entries, he provides an intimate window into the great events and quotidian trifles of being within a couple, giving us an indelible and deeply moving portrait of love in our time."

This discovery allows Hawkins to answer important questions about how we perceive the world, why we have a sense of self, and the origin of high-level thought. "

                            "\"A Thousand Brains Theory\" is a book written by Jeff Hawkins, the co-founder of Palm Computing and Numenta. The book is an exploration of the human brain and how it functions. Hawkins argues that the brain is not a computer, but rather a complex system of thousands of mini-brains, each of which is capable of processing information and learning from its environment.<br /><br />One of the key takeaways from the book is the idea that the brain is a predictive machine. Hawkins posits that the brain is constantly making predictions about the fuuture based on past experiences. These predictions help us navigate the world and make decisions. When a prediction is wrong, the brain updates its model of the world and tries again.<br /><br />Another important concept discussed in the book is the idea of the hierarchy of the brain. Hawkins argues that the brain is organized into multiple levels, with each level processing increasingly complex information. At the bottom of the hierarchy are simple sensory inputs, such as light and sound. As information moves up the hierarchy, it becomes more abstract and complex.<br /><br />Hawkins also discusses the role of feedback in the brain. He argues that feedback is essential for learning, as it allows the brain to correct its predictions and update its model of the world. Without feedback, the brain would not be able to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.<br /><br />Overall, \"A Thousand Brains Theory\" is a fascinating exploration of the human brain and how it works. Hawkins' ideas challenge traditional notions of how the brain functions and offer a new perspective on how we think and learn."

The book is an exploration of the human brain and how it functions. Hawkins argues that the brain is not a computer, but rather a complex system of thousands of mini-brains, each of which is capable of processing information and learning from its environment.<br /><br />One of the key takeaways from the book is the idea that the brain is a predictive machine. Hawkins posits that the brain is constantly making predictions about the fuuture based on past experiences. These predictions help us navigate the world and make decisions. When a prediction is wrong, the brain updates its model of the world and tries again.<br /><br />Another important concept discussed in the book is the idea of the hierarchy of the brain. Hawkins argues that the brain is organized into multiple levels, with each level processing increasingly complex information. At the bottom of the hierarchy are simple sensory inputs, such as light and sound. As information moves up the hierarchy, it becomes more abstract and complex.<br /><br />Hawkins also discusses the role of feedback in the brain. He argues that feedback is essential for learning, as it allows the brain to correct its predictions and update its model of the world. Without feedback, the brain would not be able to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.<br /><br />Overall, \"A Thousand Brains Theory\" is a fascinating exploration of the human brain and how it works. Hawkins' ideas challenge traditional notions of how the brain functions and offer a new perspective on how we think and learn.<br/>\n                                      \n    "

                            "The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed.<br /> <br />Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.<br /> <br /><i>Born a Crime</i> is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life."

                            "Trevor Noah's \"Born a Crime\" is a humorous and insightful memoir that delves into the comedian's upbringing in South Africa during and after apartheid. The book is a fascinating look at the challenges and opportunities that faced Noah as he grew up in a country that was still grappling with its past.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of the book is the humor that Noah brings to his storytelling. He uses his experiences growing up in poverty, his mischievous childhood antics, and his interactions with his mother to create a funny and engaging narrative. The infamous \"pooping on the floor\" story is just one example of the many hilarious anecdotes that Noah shares in the book.<br /><br />But beyond the humor, \"Born a Crime\" also offers a poignant look at the impact of apartheid on South Africa and its citizens. Noah's mother, who is a central figure in the book, is a strong and determined woman who instills in her son the importance of education, independence, and resilience. Through her story, and his own, Noah communicates a number of life lessons that are both inspiring and relatable.<br /><br />What makes \"Born a Crime\" so powerful is Noah's ability to balance the humor and the serious themes of the book. He is able to use his own experiences to shed light on the broader issues facing South Africa and the world. By the end of the book, readers will come away with a deeper understanding of the country and its people, as well as an appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit.<br /><br />Overall, \"Born a Crime\" is a must-read for anyone interested in South African history, memoirs, or simply a good laugh. Trevor Noah's ability to combine humor and insight make this book a truly enjoyable and enlightening read."

But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?<br /><br />Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.<br /><br />Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story nears its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways."

                            "Spanning the globe and several centuries, The Gene is the story of the quest to decipher the master-code that makes and defines humans, that governs our form and function.<br /><br />The story of the gene begins in an obscure Augustinian abbey in Moravia in 1856 where a monk stumbles on the idea of a ‘unit of heredity’. It intersects with Darwin’s theory of evolution, and collides with the horrors of Nazi eugenics in the 1940s. The gene transforms post-war biology. It reorganizes our understanding of sexuality, temperament, choice and free will. This is a story driven by human ingenuity and obsessive minds – from Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel to Francis Crick, James Watson and Rosalind Franklin, and the thousands of scientists still working to understand the code of codes.<br /><br />This is an epic, moving history of a scientific idea coming to life, by the author of The Emperor of All Maladies. But woven through The Gene, like a red line, is also an intimate history – the story of Mukherjee’s own family and its recurring pattern of mental illness, reminding us that genetics is vitally relevant to everyday lives. These concerns reverberate even more urgently today as we learn to “read” and “write” the human genome – unleashing the potential to change the fates and identities of our children.<br /><br />Majestic in its ambition, and unflinching in its honesty, The Gene gives us a definitive account of the fundamental unit of heredity – and a vision of both humanity’s past and future."

Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.<br /><br />Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.<br /><br />Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her."

These aspirations may seem out of reach, but building wealth and being happy are skills we can learn.<br /><br />So what are these skills, and how do we learn them? What are the principles that should guide our efforts? What does progress really look like?<br /><br />Naval Ravikant is an entrepreneur, philosopher, and investor who has captivated the world with his principles for building wealth and creating long-term happiness. The Almanack of Naval Ravikant is a collection of Naval's wisdom and experience from the last ten years, shared as a curation of his most insightful interviews and poignant reflections. This isn't a how-to book, or a step-by-step gimmick. Instead, through Naval's own words, you will learn how to walk your own unique path toward a happier, wealthier life."

                            "Today, He is a God. <br /><br />4000 years ago, He was just a man. <br /><br />The hunt is on. The sinister Naga warrior has killed his friend Brahaspati and now stalks his wife Sati. Shiva, the Tibetan immigrant who is the prophesied destroyer of evil, will not rest till he finds his demonic adversary. His vengeance and the path to evil will lead him to the door of the Nagas, the serpent people. Of that he is certain. <br /><br />The evidence of the malevolent rise of evil is everywhere. A kingdom is dying as it is held to ransom for a miracle drug. A crown prince is murdered. The Vasudevs Shivas philosopher guides betray his unquestioning faith as they take the aid of the dark side. Even the perfect empire, Meluha is riddled with a terrible secret in Maika, the city of births. Unknown to Shiva, a master puppeteer is playing a grand game. <br /><br />In a journey that will take him across the length and breadth of ancient India, Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries only to find that nothing is what it seems. <br /><br />Fierce battles will be fought. Surprising alliances will be forged. Unbelievable secrets will be revealed in this second book of the Shiva Trilogy, the sequel to the #1 national bestseller, The Immortals of Meluha."

                            "1900 BC. In what modern Indians mistakenly call the Indus Valley Civilisation. The inhabitants of that period called it the land of Meluha a near perfect empire created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that ever lived. This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills!<p>The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient legend: When evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge.</p><p>Is the rough-hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero? And does he want to be that hero at all? Drawn suddenly to his destiny, by duty as well as by love, will Shiva lead the Suryavanshi vengeance and destroy evil?</p>"

Since that time, all levels of military have used the teaching on Sun Tzu to warfare and civilization have adapted these teachings for use in politics, business and everyday life.

She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy. And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar. Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train...<br /><br /><i>An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45692416\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>.</i>"
